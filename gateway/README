API Gateway :
-----------
    This is a service that provides a single-entry point for certain groups of microservices.  

Functionalities of API Gateway:
------------------------------
     1) Authentication and authorization
     2) Load balancing
     3) Logging, tracing
     4) caching
     5) Routing

what is Spring Cloud Gateway?
-----------------------------
	Spring Cloud Gateway is API Gateway implementation by Spring Cloud team on top of Spring reactive ecosystem.
  It provides a simple and effective way to route incoming requests to the appropriate destination using Gateway Handler Mapping.
 And Spring Cloud Gateway uses Netty server to provide non-blocking asynchronous request processing.

Spring Cloud Gateway consists of 3 main building blocks:

Route: Think of this as the destination that we want a particular request to route to. It comprises of destination URI, a condition that has to satisfy — 
------     Or in terms of technical terms, Predicates, and one or more filters.

Predicate: This is literally a condition to match. i.e. kind of “if” condition..if requests has something — 
---------      e.g. path=blah or request header contains foo-bar etc. In technical terms, it is Java 8 Function Predicate

Filter: These are instances of Spring Framework WebFilter. This is where you can apply your magic of modifying request or response.
------  There are quite a lot of out of box WebFilter that framework provides. But of course, we are talking about Spring Framework. 
          So, rest easy folks!!! You can always add your own filter with your own logic :)

Ex:
   spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      discovery:
        locator:
          enabled: true
      routes:
      - id: employee-service
        uri: lb://employee-service
        predicates:
        - Path=/employee/**
        filters:
        - RewritePath=/employee/(?.*), /$\{path}
      - id: department-service
        uri: lb://department-service
        predicates:
        - Path=/department/**
        filters:
        - RewritePath=/department/(?.*), /$\{path}
      - id: organization-service
        uri: lb://organization-service
        predicates:
        - Path=/organization/**
        filters:
        - RewritePath=/organization/(?.*), /$\{path}
